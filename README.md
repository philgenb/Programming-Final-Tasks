# KIT Programming Course Final Projects - Winter 2020/21

This repository contains the final tasks from the **Programming** course at KIT, completed during the Winter 2020/21 semester. The assignments are implemented in Java.

## Project Structure

- **Final Task 1: Escape Route Network Analysis**
  - This project involves the design and implementation of a program to analyze and manage escape route networks using directed graphs. The goal is to calculate the maximum number of people that can safely escape within a minute from various rooms at KIT.
  - Key algorithms implemented include the **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**, used to calculate the maximum flow through escape routes in the network.
  
- **Final Task 2: Fire Breaker Game**
  - A collaborative, turn-based strategy game where 4 players must work together to extinguish forest fires on a grid-based game board. The game simulates fire spreading with wind direction and allows players to manage their fire engines, extinguish fires, and prevent further damage.
  - The game features mechanics such as action points, reputation points, water refills, and movement restrictions based on the state of the fire.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Terminal-based input/output with custom `Terminal` class for user interaction.
